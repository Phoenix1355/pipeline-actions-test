## Installation

Well, there isn't really much to be used in this, since it's a test project. But if you find something useful about the React components within the package, then this is how you'd get it.

```sh
# Using npm
npm i @chrhb/pipelines-test
```

## Usage

Then you can use the package like the following:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from '@chrhb/pipelines-test';

const App = () => (
  <div className="site">
    <Button type="outline" size="lg">Click me!</Button>
  </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('app)
);
```

## Documentation

Well, none acutally...
